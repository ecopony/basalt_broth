# Portland BES Green Stormwater Infrastructure Methods

## Research Summary

### 1. Official BES Siting Criteria

**Primary Placement Factors:**
Environmental Services prioritizes green streets placement where there is a need to:
- Reduce stormwater runoff flowing into the sewer system
- Protect water quality in nearby streams
- Protect properties from sewer backups

Additional site-specific considerations include width of planting strips, age and size of existing street trees, parking impacts (some facilities remove 2-3 parking spaces), underground utilities, street configurations, topography, soil conditions, and available space.

**Stormwater Hierarchy:**
The City's Stormwater Management Manual ranks **onsite infiltration with surface infiltration facilities at the top** of the stormwater destination/disposal hierarchy, where soil conditions allow.

**Physical Constraints:**
- Maximum side slope: 3:1 (ideal is 4:1)
- Longitudinal slope: 1-6% typical
- Groundwater clearance: 5-foot minimum from bottom of facility to high groundwater table
- Maximum clay content: 5% in engineered soil mixture
- Rain garden depth in clay soil: Maximum 6 inches

**Technical Guidance:**
The 2025 Stormwater Management Manual (SWMM), effective March 1, 2025, sets City policy and design requirements. Most projects require infiltration testing, and the Presumptive Approach Calculator (PAC) is used for facility sizing.

### 2. GIS-Based Methods

**Data Layers Used:**
Portland uses GIS tools for planning and forecasting green street projects. The Stormwater System Plan Map includes:
- Infiltration and Soils layers
- Wetted Drainage Classes
- Dominant Hydrologic Soil Groups
- Infiltration by Quarter Section
- Groundwater depth data (USGS and supplemental)
- Impervious surface data by catchment

**Watershed Priority Mapping:**
BES has developed a comprehensive stormwater system planning approach that evaluates risks from water quality, habitat, flooding, and other categories, compiling priorities in a single plan. Maps show priority implementation areas for each strategy.

### 3. Program Documentation

**History and Scale:**
- 2003: First Green Streets pilot demonstration projects
- 2005: Citywide Green Streets program initiated
- 2011: Big Pipe Project completed (94% CSO reduction to Willamette)
- 2025: Over 3,000 GSI facilities total

**Current Performance:**
- ~2,500 green street planters capturing ~200 million gallons/year
- 56,000+ downspout disconnections removing 1.2 billion gallons/year
- Total green infrastructure captures ~2.3 billion gallons annually
- CSOs reduced 94% (Willamette) and 99% (Columbia Slough)

**Key Study:** "The First Thirty Years of Green Stormwater Infrastructure in Portland, Oregon" (MDPI Sustainability, 2025) provides comprehensive retrospective.

### 4. Performance Data

**Pollutant Removal (from Portland studies):**
A two-year study of seven lined bioretention facilities found:
- TSS: 94% decrease
- Ammonia: 85% decrease
- Total Copper: 59% decrease
- Total Zinc: 80% decrease
- However: Nitrate increased 2,070%, Orthophosphate increased 141%

**Peak Flow Reduction:**
Modeling showed green street designs reduced peak flows to combined sewer by 80-85%.

**Lined vs. Unlined Facilities:**
- Unlined facilities had healthier plants and more plant cover
- Trial soil blend showed 9.5% higher soil moisture in lined facilities

### 5. Lessons Learned and Challenges

**Climate Challenges:**
- Hotter, drier summers stress vegetation in green streets
- Many facilities designed without irrigation systems
- Plant survival and functionality being compromised
- Sandy soil drains quickly, exacerbating heat stress

**Maintenance:**
- Requires skills current staff may not have ("staff who manage buried pipes may not be good gardeners")
- Portland employs 3 full-time staff plus contractors
- Work batched by location with quarterly maintenance
- Green Street Stewards volunteer program reduces costs

**Cost-Effectiveness:**
Green streets are "more cost-effective than piping stormwater to a treatment plant" and eliminate need for expensive belowground repairs.

### 6. Equity Considerations

Portland's Climate Action Plan acknowledges the need to deploy green infrastructure in underserved communities, specifically highlighting East Portland where disparities in access to green space leave populations susceptible to heat and pollution impacts. The Portland Clean Energy Fund (established 2018) distributes $44-61 million annually, with at least 50% of programs required to benefit communities of color and low-income Portlanders.

## Key Implications for Our Model

1. **Siting criteria are well-defined** - BES has clear physical constraints (slope 3:1, 5ft groundwater, <5% clay) that we should incorporate
2. **GIS layers align with our data plan** - They use infiltration, soil groups, groundwater depth, impervious surfaces
3. **Validation opportunity** - 3,000+ facilities with monitoring data; 2025 retrospective paper is a key resource
4. **Performance benchmarks** - 80-85% peak flow reduction, 94% TSS removal are achievable targets
5. **Equity is an explicit consideration** - We should include neighborhood equity metrics in optimization
