# Urban Drainage Network Analysis: Strahler Ordering and Alternative Methods

*Research conducted February 2026*

## Executive Summary

This research investigates whether Strahler stream ordering and natural watershed network analysis methods can be applied to urban drainage systems. The findings reveal that while Strahler ordering has been successfully adapted for urban sewer network simplification, significant modifications and alternative approaches are required due to fundamental differences between natural and urban hydrological systems.

## 1. Strahler Ordering in Urban Contexts

### 1.1 Direct Applications to Urban Sewer Networks

**Yes, Strahler ordering has been successfully applied to urban drainage networks:**

Researchers have adapted Strahler numbering for storm sewer systems by incrementally analyzing higher-order sewer pipes. Key findings:

- **Network Simplification**: In a study coupling SWMM with LISFLOOD-FP for urban inundation modeling, the Strahler ordering method reduced a network of 95,219 pipes and 95,318 nodes down to 604 pipes and 606 nodes while maintaining functional accuracy ([MDPI Water, 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/17/7/990)).

- **Avoiding Randomness**: The Strahler ordering method "constructs clear topological relations of the drainage network and shows good performance in drainage network simplification."

- **Flood Modeling**: Different scenarios of data completeness have been generated by simplifying sewer networks based on Strahler Order number and pipe length ([IWA Publishing](https://iwaponline.com/wst/article/90/9/2673/105195/Fully-automated-simplification-of-urban-drainage)).

### 1.2 Horton's Laws and Fractal Properties

Horton's empirical laws have also been applied to artificial drainage:

- **Bifurcation ratio = 4.2** and **length ratio = 2.1** (from natural river analogs) can be used for pipe density optimization ([ESRI](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc06/papers/papers/pap_1997.pdf)).

## 2. Urban Drainage Network Analysis Methods

### 2.1 Graph Theory and Complex Network Analysis

Complex network theory has emerged as a powerful framework:

**Centrality Metrics for Pipe Importance:**

- **Edge Betweenness Centrality**: Ranks pipes by how many flow paths pass through them. Critical for identifying bottlenecks ([Water Resources Research, 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022WR032277)).

- **Relevance-Based Centrality**: Combines intrinsic relevance (product of pipe length and flow) with topological centrality ([River Journal, 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.30)).

- **Eigenvector Centrality**: Identifies locations requiring redundant flow paths ([Applied Network Science, 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41109-019-0247-8)).

**Key Insight**: Urban drainage networks are typically tree-like graphs where edges = nodes - 1, differing from looped natural stream networks.

### 2.2 Topology Derivation from Surface Data

For cities lacking complete sewer data, algorithms estimate below-ground networks from street networks, topography, and land use ([HESS, 2022](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/4279/2022/)). Graph Neural Networks are also being applied ([ScienceDirect, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670724007017)).

### 2.3 Dual Drainage Modeling (1D/2D Coupled Models)

Modern urban flood modeling uses coupled approaches:
- **1D Component**: Models sewer pipe flow
- **2D Component**: Models surface overland flow

Key feature: Bidirectional flow exchange between surface and subsurface at inlets/manholes.

## 3. Scientific Validity: Limitations and Assumptions

### 3.1 Key Differences Between Natural Watersheds and Urban Drainage

| Characteristic | Natural Watershed | Urban Drainage |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Flow Paths** | Surface follows topography | Subsurface pipes cross topographic boundaries |
| **Connectivity** | Continuous branching | Discrete inlets with artificial routing |
| **Infiltration** | Significant soil absorption | Minimal (impervious surfaces) |
| **Response Time** | Slower, buffered | Rapid, flashy |
| **Network Structure** | Dendritic, self-similar | Often linear along streets |
| **Boundary Definition** | Topographically defined | Infrastructure-defined |

### 3.2 Violated Assumptions

1. **Topographic Control**: Urban pipes can move water across ridges, independent of surface slope.

2. **Continuous Flow Accumulation**: Discrete inlet points create discontinuities in accumulation patterns.

3. **Self-Similarity/Fractality**: Urban networks are designed artifacts that may not exhibit natural fractal properties.

4. **Flow Direction Consistency**: Curbs/gutters redirect flow; inlets capture before natural low points; pipes impose different directions.

5. **Watershed Boundary Stability**: Urban infrastructure can alter effective drainage area by 17% or more ([Springer, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43832-024-00083-z)).

### 3.3 D8 Algorithm Limitations

- Fails in flat terrain (common in graded urban areas)
- Cannot represent curb/gutter flow
- Ignores subsurface pipe routing
- "Snaps" flow to 8 directions, introducing systematic errors

## 4. Alternative Approaches That Work for Urban Drainage

### 4.1 GIS-Based Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA)

The dominant approach for green infrastructure siting:

**Common Factors:**
- Slope (typically <6% for bioswales)
- Soil infiltration rate / hydrologic soil group
- Depth to groundwater (>5 ft typically required)
- Proximity to drainage network
- Land use / zoning constraints
- Equity indicators

**Tools:**
- EPA BMP Siting Tool ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/best-management-practices-bmps-siting-tool))
- FRUGISP model ([Nature, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94851-z))
- GISP model

### 4.2 Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)

TWI = ln(a / tan(b)) where a = upslope area, b = local slope

**Urban Applications:**
- Identifies high water accumulation potential
- More cost-efficient than full hydrodynamic modeling
- Used in Illinois for flood awareness ([ISWS, 2017](https://www.isws.illinois.edu/pubdoc/CR/ISWSCR2017-02.pdf))
- Can be calibrated with SAR data for SuDS placement ([MDPI, 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/2/598))

### 4.3 Hybrid DEM + Pipe Network Integration

- Surface pathways integrated with pipe networks "burned into" DEMs
- Requires high-resolution LiDAR (1m or better)
- Must know pipe locations, invert elevations, connectivity

### 4.4 Network-Based Vulnerability and Prioritization

**Runoff Edge Betweenness Centrality:**
- Identifies critical pipes without hydraulic simulations
- Much faster than full SWMM runs for screening

**Pipe Importance Ranking:**
- Larger diameter pipes generally more critical
- Integration of condition index + failure probability + centrality

### 4.5 Optimization Algorithms for GSI Placement

1. **Genetic Algorithms**: NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization
2. **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**: Outperforms simpler strategies for flood reduction
3. **Simulated Annealing**: Explored for layout optimization
4. **Parameter Sweeps**: BehaviorSpace-style exhaustive search

## 5. Bioswale-Specific Siting Criteria

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Slope** | 1-2% optimal; check dams if >4%; not >6% |
| **Side Slopes** | 3:1 maximum |
| **Soil Type** | Groups A or B preferred |
| **Infiltration Rate** | 1.0-6.0 in/hr |
| **Groundwater Depth** | Min 5 ft clearance |
| **Drainage Area** | Typically <5 acres |

## 6. Implications for the Basalt Broth NetLogo Model

### 6.1 What Can Be Borrowed from Stream Network Analysis

1. **Strahler ordering** - For network simplification if modeling pipes explicitly
2. **Graph centrality metrics** - Identify high-priority intervention locations
3. **Horton's ratios** - Validate realistic network structure

### 6.2 What Must Be Modified or Avoided

1. **Pure D8 flow accumulation** - Must account for curbs, inlets, and pipes
2. **Topographic watershed boundaries** - Pipe network data essential
3. **Continuous flow assumption** - Use discrete inlet interception events

### 6.3 Recommended Approach

1. **Surface Flow**: Modified D8 with streets as preferential flow paths; TWI for accumulation hotspots
2. **Inlet Capture**: Water agents flow until intercepted by inlet agents
3. **Bioswale Siting**: Multi-criteria overlay as primary screen, then ABM simulation for performance evaluation
4. **Validation**: Compare against Portland BES's 3,000+ existing GSI facilities
5. **Network Importance**: Calculate betweenness centrality to identify bottlenecks
